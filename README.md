## Overview
In Tanzania, water wells become non-functional due to various factors such as quantity of water available in the wells, the source of the water feeding the well and the management group.
Identifying non-functional wells will help prioritize maintenance efforts and improve water infrastructure planning. 
This analysis aims to develop a machine learning classifier that predicts the condition of water wells based on features like water point type, construction year, and other factors. 
The model will categorize wells as functional or non-functional.
## Business Objectives
Develop a classification model to predict whether a well is functional or non-functional using historical data.
Implement and compare multiple algorithms to identify the most effective model for well functionality prediction.
Improve prediction accuracy through feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and handling class imbalances.
## Business Questions
What factors contribute most to well failures?
Which regions have the highest concentration of non-functional wells?
How does the construction year affect well failure rates?
## Methods 
The methods used in the analysis are as follows:
Data Collection, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis - correlations, Linear regression, Logistics regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour
## Insights from the analysis and modeling
This histogram illustrates the distribution of well construction years, revealing a significant rise in well development since the 1960s, with a peak in the late 2000s.


This plot shows well status by location.
